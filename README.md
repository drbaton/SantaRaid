Santa Raid!

December 25th, around 3 a.m.... You've just finished packing presents around the globe and are returning home when Rudolph the reindeer feels sick and runs off into the bushes, 
where you can hear him groaning and squealing (he's been snacking on dumplings all evening, and he's eaten so many of them...). Frozen, you set off on your own to find a pharmacy with laxatives for Rudolph. 
Along the way, however, you have to watch out for kids wanting more presents and piles of snow (fortunately, someone left some energy-boosting Christmas cake on the road).

I invite everyone interested to try my game "Santa Raid" – a clone of the iconic River Raid for the Atari 2600, but with a Christmas theme 😉 
The compressed game (Windows 10, 11, 64-bit) can be downloaded and unpacked with source code:
https://github.com/drbaton/SantaRaid

qb64pe build on win11, with music. 
- splash image - generated with GencraftAI
- music - generated with suno.ai (music amd vocals, lyrics was written by myself)

 in case of problems with running, allow windows defender to run it. If you don't want, you can try run it in qb64pe (bas file). 
 If any other problems with running occurs (not with windows defender) you can contact me at drbaton@gmail.com

 Enjoy!
